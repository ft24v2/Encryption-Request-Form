Encryption-Request-Form
=======================

The Encryption Request Form is a simple program to allow technicians to:

- Gather Client Information
- Gather System Information
- Gather Workorder Information

And then have all of this exported to an Excel File and Html file. From there the technician can print out the form,
and have a fully automated, fully filled out form.
